    <h1>Lentil Stew</h1>

    <h2>Simple, vegan lentil dish</h2>
    
    <p>Prepared with few ingredients and just as little effort and just perfect to cook it in stock. This is my favorite vegan lentil stew.
        Maybe, oh what, <strong>certainly</strong> you have lentil stew so or so similar, as I serve it to you today already thousands of times eaten. Therefore, it is now time to leave aside whether it needs for a simple, vegan lentil stew at all another recipe. But for me, my own favorite lentil stew is always a bit like a comforting, warm hug. A little bit of "ideal world" to spoon up. The little comforting plaster that everyone can use from time to time. That alone is why I want to share it with you today.
